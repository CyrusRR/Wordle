# Wordle

This is a recreation of the popular game, Wordle, that I wrote for fun in C++. It features the emoji printout, a visual representation of the active keyboard, and indicators of the status of each letter of the guess


Improvements coming soon: 
- In the official Wordle game, if a guess has 2 duplicate letters and the answer only has one, the first in the guess will be green/yellow depending on the placement, while the second was grey.
- In my version, the second will be yellow, even if there is just one of the letters. So in official wordle: 

Answer: smart\n
Guess:  treat\n

The first t will be grey and final t will be green.

But in my version, the first t will be yellow, and the final will be green.

This fix will be coming soon!
